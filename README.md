# Concepts:
This is an introductory course in database management systems. It examines data structures, file organizations, concepts, and principles of database management systems (DBMS); as well as, data analysis, database design, data modeling, database management and database implementation. More specifically, it introduces hierarchical, network and relational data models; entity-relationship modeling; basics of Structured Query Language (SQL); data normalization; and database design. This course provides hands-on experience in database design and implementation through assignments, lab exercises and course projects. This course also introduces advanced database concepts such as transaction management and concurrency control, distributed databases, multi-tier client/server architectures, database applications, improving query performance through indexing, and advanced data query patterns for extract-transform-load.
